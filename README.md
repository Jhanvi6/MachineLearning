# MachineLearning

This file contains the Machine Learning Assignments undertaken by me:

1. The first assignment comprised of analysing performance of 3 Machine learning Algorithms with appropriate pre-processing - k-Nearest Neighbors, Na√Øve Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithm to classify grayscale images into 10 different categories, while ensuring no use of external libraries for pre-processing and classification.

2. The second assignment applies machine learning and data mining methods to accurately classify the CIFAR-100 dataset.In this project, my team and I implemented Random Forest, CNN and SVM, with CNN giving the highest accuracy
